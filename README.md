# Linux-Archive-Program  myar.c - 
Program creates and reads .ar files created by the Linux ar utility. This code is functional, but needs to be refactored quite badly. I created this entire program in a week, and was in a big rush to finish it, so I ended up copying and pasting a lot of code, instead of creating functions that could be re-used. I plan to come back to it and make it prettier eventually. 

uniquify.c - 
Program strips punctiation and special characters and pulls unique words from a document. 

pipeline.c - 
Program demonstrates use of Linux pipelines.
